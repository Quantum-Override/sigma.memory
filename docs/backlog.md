## Bugs / Correctness Gaps

### BG-01 — `registers_get`/`registers_set`: `-Wtype-limits` warning 🟠 High

**File:** `src/memory.c:92,100`  
**Problem:** `sbyte index` (signed 8-bit) is compared against `index < 0`. Because `sbyte` is
`int8_t`, GCC correctly warns `-Wtype-limits: comparison is always false due to limited range of
data type` when building with `-Wextra` (e.g., via `cbuild lib`). The guard can never fire.

**What it solves:** Eliminates a dead guard, silences the warning, and prevents the function from
silently accepting invalid index values with no bounds enforcement.

**Fix:** Change `sbyte index` to `byte index` (unsigned 8-bit, per `sigma.core/types.h`). Add `assert(index <= 7)` in debug builds.

---

### BG-02 — `SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING` silently degrades for user arenas 🟠 High

**File:** `src/memory.c` / `include/memory.h`  
**Problem:** `SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING = 0` is documented as "first-fit with block reuse (SYS0
only)". When a caller passes it to `Allocator.create_arena()`, the arena silently uses bump
allocation (same as `SCOPE_POLICY_DYNAMIC`) — there is no reclaiming behaviour and no error.
This is a silent semantic mismatch.

**What it solves:** Prevents user confusion when arenas don't free and reuse blocks as they
expect. Either enforce the constraint (return `NULL`/log error when `RECLAIMING` is passed to
`create_arena`) or implement reclaiming arenas.

**Fix:** `create_arena(name, SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING)` should create a `SlabAllocator` scope — B-tree-tracked, split/coalesce, individual dispose — essentially a named SLB0-equivalent. Arenas will **always** remain pure bump; `RECLAIMING` is the signal to create a user slab. See FT-05.

---

### BG-03 — `SCOPE_POLICY_FIXED` enforcement for arenas untested 🟡 Medium

**File:** `src/memory.c` — `arena_alloc_for_scope`  
**Problem:** `SCOPE_POLICY_FIXED` is declared and documented but no test suite verifies it
actually returns `NULL` when the first (and only) page is exhausted. If the bump allocator chains
pages regardless of the policy flag, the fixed constraint is silently violated.

**What it solves:** Prevents silent over-allocation in size-bounded use cases (e.g., plugin
sandboxes with a hard memory cap).

**Fix:** Add a policy guard in the arena allocator path + add test cases `FXD-01..03` (alloc up
to limit returns data, alloc past limit returns NULL, page_count stays at 1).

---

### BG-04 — No coalescing in SYS0's B-tree after `realloc` shrink-split 🟡 Medium

**File:** `src/memory.c` — `slb0_realloc`  
**Problem:** When `realloc` shrinks a block and splits the remainder into a free node, adjacent
free nodes are not automatically coalesced. Sequential shrink → realloc cycles on the same
region can fragment SYS0 into many small free nodes, degrading B-tree search performance toward
O(n).

**What it solves:** Prevents long-term fragmentation accumulation in workloads that repeatedly
resize allocations.

**Fix:** After inserting the split free node, call the existing coalesce path
(`btree_coalesce` / `node_free`) to merge with any adjacent free block.

---

## Missing Features

### ~~FT-01~~ — Thread safety hooks ✅ Superseded (v0.3.0)

**Resolution:** The hook-based lock/unlock callback model has been superseded by the
**Trusted Subsystem Registration** design (see `docs/plan-v0.3.0.md`). Sigma.Tasking registers
with Memory to receive a dedicated slab and control page. Fiber arenas are carved from that slab
and never enter `scope_table`, eliminating the shared mutable state concern for the fibers-as-
arenas use case. Single-instance per-thread usage remains safe as documented.

The original hook model aimed to add locks around existing paths; the registration model instead
gives Tasking its own isolated region, so no locking of shared paths is needed for fiber memory.
Global SYS0 mutation guards (if ever needed) will be addressed in the Ring 0 implementation
where memory initialisation is single-threaded by construction.

**Closed:** March 11, 2026

---

### FT-01b — Thread safety (Sigma.Tasking integration) [ARCHIVE — original text]

**File:** `include/memory.h:29` — "designed for single-threaded, non-concurrent use"  
**Problem:** All allocation paths share mutable global state (registers, scope table, page
chains) with no synchronisation. Any concurrent access produces data races and undefined
behaviour.

**What it solves:** Enables `sigma.memory` in multi-threaded runtimes (Sigma.Tasking, server
request handlers, parallel test runners).

**Design notes (from ROADMAP):**
- Hook-based model: Sigma.Tasking supplies lock/unlock callbacks; `sigma.memory` calls them
  around critical sections. No direct pthread dependency.
- Thread-local `R7` (current scope) is likely the right model; global SYS0 mutations need a
  global lock.
- Blocked on: Sigma.Tasking API stability.

> ⚠️ **Sigma.Tasking is entering active planning.** Revisit this item as soon as Sigma.Tasking API design begins. Hook signatures must be co-designed with it.

---

### FT-02 — `Allocator.alloc(size, bool zee)` — zero-init parameter 🟠 High

**Problem:** There is no zero-initialising allocation primitive. Every caller that needs zeroed
memory must call `Allocator.alloc` + `memset`, which is error-prone (forgetting `memset`),
verbose, and misses potential OS-provided zero pages.

**What it solves:** Reduces boilerplate; avoids unintentional use of uninitialised memory.

**Design:** This parameter was present in early prototyping. Restore `bool zee` on `alloc`
rather than adding a separate `calloc`. When `zee == true`, zero the allocation before returning.
For fresh mmap'd pages the OS already zeroes them — an optimised path can skip `memset` in that
case.

```c
object buf  = Allocator.alloc(256, false);  // existing behaviour
object zbuf = Allocator.alloc(256, true);   // zeroed on return
```

> ⚠️ **Breaking change** — all existing `Allocator.alloc(size)` call sites must be updated to
> `alloc(size, false)`. Requires a minor version bump and a migration guide.

---

### FT-03 — Scope introspection / stats API 🟠 High

**Problem:** There is no way to query the live state of a scope: how many pages it holds, how
many bytes are allocated, how many free nodes exist, or what the fragmentation ratio is.
Debugging allocation pressure or memory leaks requires attaching a debugger.

**What it solves:** Enables real-time monitoring, test assertions on allocator state, and
profiling without external tools.

**Proposed API:**
```c
typedef struct sc_scope_stats {
    usize page_count;          // Mapped pages
    usize alloc_bytes;         // Live allocated bytes
    usize free_bytes;          // Free bytes tracked in B-tree
    usize free_node_count;     // Free B-tree entries (fragmentation proxy)
    usize largest_free_block;  // Max contiguous free bytes (single alloc limit)
} sc_scope_stats;

integer Allocator.Scope.stats(scope s, sc_scope_stats *out);
```

**Effort:** Low — data already lives on the scope struct; this is an accessor/aggregator, not a new data structure.

---

### ~~FT-04~~ — Arena frame support ✅ Resolved (v0.2.3)

**Resolution:** `Frame.begin_in(scope)` / `Frame.end_in(scope, frame)` and
`Arena.frame_begin(scope)` / `Arena.frame_end(scope, frame)` were implemented in the v0.2.3
sub-interface split. Frames within arenas work without changing R7.

**Follow-up:** Add `test/unit/test_arena_frames.c` to confirm `begin_in` + `end_in` on a
user arena allocates, bulk-disposes correctly, and leaves the arena intact. Tracked as TG-06.

---

### FT-05 — `SlabAllocator` scope via `SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING` 🟡 Medium

**Problem:** There is no way to create a user-defined slab scope (B-tree-tracked, individual
alloc/dispose, split/coalesce) beyond the single built-in SLB0. User arenas are pure bump only.

**What it solves:** Allows subsystems that need full reclaiming allocation semantics to get an
isolated, named slab scope — essentially a user-created SLB0 equivalent.

**Design:** Arenas will **always** be pure bump. `SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING` passed to
`create_arena(name, SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING)` returns a new `SlabAllocator` scope — backed by
skip list + per-page B-trees, not a bump arena. All SLB0 mechanics apply: dynamic page growth,
page release on empty, `realloc`, coalesce.

**Implementation:** Each user scope already has a NodePool (v0.2.2). Wire
`arena_alloc_for_scope` / `arena_dispose_for_scope` through the `slb0_alloc` / `slb0_dispose`
path when `policy == SCOPE_POLICY_RECLAIMING`. Bulk-dispose (`dispose_arena`) still applies.

**See also:** BG-02 — must be fixed before or alongside this feature.

---

### FT-06 — B-tree rebalancing (pathological fragmentation protection) � Low

**File:** `src/node_pool.c`  
**Problem:** The per-page B-tree is an unbalanced BST ordered by block start address. For
pathological allocation patterns (many same-size allocs, free in sorted order), the tree
degenerates to a linked list, turning O(log n) searches into O(n).

**What it solves:** Maintains O(log n) worst-case guarantee regardless of allocation pattern.

**Options:** AVL rotation (lightweight, predictable) or red-black tree (standard).
Alternatively, a skip list at the B-tree level (consistent with the outer skip list design).

**Note:** By design, per-page B-trees stay shallow (≤ ~15 nodes per page). Degenerate cases
are unlikely in practice and may never warrant balancing. Re-evaluate only if profiling under
adversarial workloads shows measurable O(n) behaviour.

---

### FT-07 — `Allocator.Scope.resize(scope, new_policy)` — post-creation policy change 🟢 Low

**Problem:** Scope policy is fixed at creation time and cannot be changed. An arena created with
`SCOPE_POLICY_DYNAMIC` cannot be downgraded to `SCOPE_POLICY_FIXED` after initial pages are
mapped.

**What it solves:** Supports lifecycle transitions — e.g., a pre-loading phase (dynamic) that
locks down to fixed capacity once initialisation is complete, preventing runaway growth.

---

### FT-08 — Memory pressure callbacks / exhaustion hooks 🟡 Medium

**Problem:** When SLB0 or an arena approaches exhaustion, the caller only learns about it via a
`NULL` return from `alloc`. There is no pre-emptive notification to allow graceful degradation
(e.g., flush caches, compact, or reject new work before allocations start failing).

**What it solves:** Enables robust memory management in embedded or constrained environments
where `NULL` from `alloc` may be too late to recover gracefully.

**Proposed API:**
```c
typedef void (*sc_pressure_fn)(scope s, usize free_bytes, void *ctx);
integer Allocator.Scope.on_pressure(scope s, sc_pressure_fn fn, void *ctx, usize threshold);
```

---

### FT-09 — `SCOPE_FLAG_SECURE` zeroing on dispose 🟡 Medium

**File:** `include/memory.h` — `SCOPE_FLAG_SECURE = 0x04` declared but not implemented  
**Problem:** The `SCOPE_FLAG_SECURE` flag is defined in `sc_scope_flags` but `slb0_dispose` and
`arena_dispose_for_scope` do not check it or zero memory on free. Sensitive data (keys, tokens,
credentials) survives in freed blocks and is exposed to subsequent allocations.

**What it solves:** Crypto and security workloads that require memory scrubbing before reuse.

**Implementation:** In `slb0_dispose` / `arena_dispose_for_scope`, check `scope->flags &
SCOPE_FLAG_SECURE`; if set, `memset(ptr, 0, size)` before inserting the free node into the
B-tree.

**Effort:** Low — `memset` + a flag check in two functions.

---

### FT-10 — `Allocator.Scope.compact(scope)` — explicit defragmentation 🟢 Low

**Problem:** There is no way for callers to trigger a B-tree compaction pass. Over time, heavy
alloc/free cycling leaves the B-tree with many small free nodes. The coalesce pass runs
opportunistically on `dispose`, but callers cannot force a full-scope merge.

**What it solves:** Allows batch applications (compilers, parsers) to compact after a heavy
phase before starting the next, recovering contiguous free space for large allocations.

---

### FT-11 — Trusted Subsystem Registration (Ring0/Ring1 Model) 🔴 Critical (v0.3.x)

**Branch:** `feature/ft-11-trusted-subsystem`

**Context:** Sigma.Memory is the foundational Ring0 allocator. Trusted Ring1 subsystems (Sigma.Tasking,
Anvil.Lite, Sigma.IO, Sigma.IRQ, Sigma.Messaging) require dedicated, protected memory regions with
direct controller access, bypassing the shared SLB0 facade.

**Module system integration:** Each trusted subsystem declares its needs in `sigma_module_t`:
```c
static const sigma_module_t tasking_module = {
    .name         = "sigma.tasking",
    .role         = SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED,
    .arena_size   = 512 * 1024,     // 512 KB; 0 = system default (256 KB)
    .arena_policy = POLICY_RECLAIM, // first-fit free list (fiber stacks need arbitrary free)
    .deps         = tasking_deps,
    .init         = tasking_module_init,   // receives sc_trusted_cap_t* as ctx
    .shutdown     = tasking_module_shutdown,
};
```

**Register map:**
```
R0 = s_sys0_base               (sigma.memory self — set at bootstrap)
R1 = first trusted slot        (sigma.tasking — sequential assignment)
R2 = second trusted slot       (anvil.lite — messaging + event bus)
R3–R6 = future Ring1 slots    (sigma.io, sigma.irq, sigma.msg, ...)
R7 = SLB0 ctrl                 (immutable — set at bootstrap, never changes)
```

**`sc_trusted_cap_t`** (full definition in `include/memory.h`):
```c
typedef struct sc_trusted_cap_s {
    uint8_t         reg_slot;   // R[n] where this module's ctrl is stored (1–6)
    slab            arena;      // dedicated slab — never touches SLB0
    sc_ctrl_base_s *ctrl;       // reclaim or bump ctrl over the arena
    sc_alloc_use_t  alloc_use;  // {alloc, free, realloc} hooks — passed as init(ctx)
} sc_trusted_cap_t;
```

**Grant flow** (at `sigma_module_init_all()` time):
1. sigma.memory `init()` registers grant fn: `sigma_module_set_trusted_grant(trusted_grant_fn)`
2. `sigma_module_init_all()` (sigma.core) encounters `SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED` module
3. Calls `trusted_grant_fn(mod->name, mod->arena_size, mod->arena_policy)`
4. sigma.memory: `Allocator.acquire(size)` → create ctrl over slab → stamp `R[next_slot]` → return cap
5. Module system passes `cap*` as `ctx` to `mod->init(ctx)`
6. Trusted module stores cap, uses `cap->alloc_use` for all internal allocations

**What it solves:**
- Dedicated slabs that never touch SLB0 fragmentation budget
- O(1) lookup of any trusted module's arena via its R-slot
- Module-declared size and controller type (reclaim for fiber stacks, bump for scratch arenas)
- Forward-compatible with Ring0 OS model: same API, bootstrap-time allocation instead of runtime mmap
- Up to 6 trusted Ring1 subsystems before Ring2 user modules

**Planned Ring1 subsystems (in expected registration order):**
| Slot | Module | Role |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | sigma.tasking | Fiber task scheduler; needs arbitrary alloc/free for stacks |
| R2 | anvil.lite | System messaging + event bus; compulsory for all subsystems |
| R3 | sigma.io | Async I/O, DMA |
| R4 | sigma.irq | Interrupt routing |
| R5–6 | reserved | Future Ring1 expansion |

**Scope:**
- `include/memory.h` — `sc_trusted_cap_t` definition, `memory_trusted_cap(uint8_t slot)` diagnostic
- `src/memory.c` — `trusted_grant()` impl, `s_next_trusted_slot` counter (starts at 1, max 6)
- `src/module.c` — register grant fn in `memory_module_init()` after `init_memory_system()`
- `../sigma.core/src/module.c` — cross-repo: dispatch TRUSTED branch in `sigma_module_init_all()`
- `../sigma.core/include/sigma.core/module.h` — `arena_size` + `arena_policy` fields in `sigma_module_t` ✅ done
- `test/unit/test_trusted.c` — TRS-01..07

---

### FT-12 — `SCOPE_POLICY_RESOURCE`: explicit-lifetime slab scopes 🟡 Medium

**See full plan:** `docs/plan-ft12-resource-scope.md`

**Problem:** There is no allocation path for large, contiguous memory (file buffers, asset blobs,
context-scoped scratch regions) that: (a) exceeds `SYS0_PAGE_SIZE`, (b) has an explicit lifetime
independent of R7, and (c) carries zero MTIS overhead. Direct use of `mmap` works around the
size limit but leaves the allocation invisible to sigma.memory and subject to manual lifetime
management. Arenas auto-push R7 on creation, imposing LIFO disposal ordering that does not match
all usage patterns (see BUG-001).

**What it solves:** A resource scope is a single `mmap`'d slab of arbitrary size, bump-allocated,
owned by the caller, with no R7 coupling, no NodePool, no skip list, no B-tree. Lifetime is
explicit: `acquire` at creation, `release` at disposal. Any number of resource scopes may be
live simultaneously in any order; `release` does not affect R7 or any other scope.

**Design summary:**
- New typedef `rscope` (`struct sc_rscope *`) — layout-compatible with `scope` in the common
  prefix; directly castable. `sizeof(sc_rscope) == 96` (matches `SCOPE_ENTRY_SIZE`).
- New struct `sc_rscope`: `slab_base`, `bump_pos`, `slab_capacity` replace the NodePool/page
  fields of `sc_scope`. Frame support fields are identical — frames save/restore the bump cursor.
- New policy constant: `SCOPE_POLICY_RESOURCE = 3`
- New sub-interface: `Allocator.Resource` — `acquire`, `alloc`, `reset(s, bool zero)`, `release`,
  `frame_begin`, `frame_end`. `reset(s, false)` is O(1); `reset(s, true)` zeroes the slab.
- `Scope.set` returns `ERR` for resource scopes — they never enter the R7 chain.
- `Scope.alloc(resource_scope, ...)` returns `NULL` — callers must use `Resource.alloc`.
- `shutdown_memory_system` walks slots 2–15 and `munmap`s any unreleased resource scopes.

**Tests:** RS-01 through RS-11 in `test/unit/test_resource_scope.c` (see plan).

**Effort:** Medium — new struct, new sub-interface (~6 functions), dispatch guards in 3 existing
functions, shutdown update, 11 TDD tests.

---

### FT-13 — `String.use()`: user-controlled allocation routing for sigma.text 🟠 High

**Status:** Proposal pending Sigma.Core team review.

**Problem:** Every `String.*` and `StringBuilder.*` operation calls `Allocator.alloc/free/realloc`
unconditionally, always dispatching to SLB0. A caller who acquires a `bump_allocator` for a
parse pass or render frame gets zero performance benefit for string allocations — they still hit
the reclaim path. There is no signal that this is happening; the user silently gets the wrong
allocator.

**What it solves:** Strings are typically the dominant allocation workload in text-processing and
compile-time tooling. A single `String.use(ctrl)` call makes the fast path explicit, eliminates
the hidden SLB0 cost for scoped string workloads, and unblocks the natural frame-rollback pattern
— `String.dispose` becomes a no-op under a bump controller, and `frame_end` reclaims everything
instantaneously.

**Proposed solution:**

**(A) Sigma.Core — `sc_ctrl_base_s` becomes a vtable base** (`sigma.core/allocator.h`)  
Add `alloc` and `free` function pointers directly to `sc_ctrl_base_s`:

```c
struct sc_ctrl_base_s {
    sc_alloc_policy  policy;
    slab             backing;
    usize            struct_size;
    object         (*alloc)(struct sc_ctrl_base_s *, usize);  // NEW
    void           (*free) (struct sc_ctrl_base_s *, object); // NEW — no-op for bump
    void           (*shutdown)(struct sc_ctrl_base_s *);
};
```

This turns `sc_ctrl_base_s` into a true polymorphic base. Any pointer to it can dispatch
alloc/free without knowing the concrete controller type. `allocator_create_bump` wires
`free` to a no-op; `allocator_create_reclaim` wires both to live implementations.

**(B) Sigma.Core — `sc_string_i` gains a `use` slot** (`sigma.text/include/strings.h`)  

```c
typedef struct sc_string_i {
    // ... existing slots ...
    void (*use)(sc_ctrl_base_s *ctrl);  // NULL → revert to default (SLB0 or malloc)
} sc_string_i;
```

**(C) Sigma.Text — internal dispatch** (`src/strings.c`)  
- `static sc_ctrl_base_s *s_string_ctrl = NULL` — module-level active controller.  
- Replace every `Allocator.alloc(n)` with `s_string_ctrl->alloc(s_string_ctrl, n)` when
  non-NULL, else `malloc(n)`.  
- Replace every `Allocator.free(p)` with `s_string_ctrl->free(s_string_ctrl, p)` when
  non-NULL, else `free(p)`.  
- `strings.h` drops `#include <sigma.core/allocator.h>` — depends on `sigma.core/types.h` only.

**(D) Sigma.Memory — inject default controller** (`src/memory.c`, `init_memory_system`)  
After SLB0 bootstrap: `String.use((sc_ctrl_base_s *)s_slb0_ctrl)`. This makes SLB0 the default
for all String allocations without sigma.text needing to link against or know about sigma.memory.
When sigma.memory is not linked, the `malloc`/`free` fallback path applies automatically.

**Drop the shim:** Once (C) lands, sigma.text no longer calls `Allocator.*`. The file
`sigma.core/allocator.h` is currently installed as a public sigma.core header solely because
sigma.text depends on it. That dependency is gone. The file becomes sigma.memory's internal
contract and can be removed from sigma.core's public surface (`/usr/local/include/sigma.core/`).
sigma.core ships `types.h` + `memory.h` only.

**User story:**

```c
slab s            = Allocator.acquire(2 * 1024 * 1024);
bump_allocator ba = Allocator.create_bump(s);
String.use((sc_ctrl_base_s *)ba);        // all String ops → bump now

frame f = ba->frame_begin(ba);
string r = String.concat(a, b);          // → bump_ctrl_alloc
String.dispose(r);                       // → no-op (bump: free is a no-op)
ba->frame_end(ba, f);                    // entire frame gone instantly

String.use(NULL);                        // revert to default (SLB0 or malloc)
```

**Effort:** Medium — two new slots on `sc_ctrl_base_s`, one new slot on `sc_string_i`, internal
dispatch rewrite in `strings.c` (~12 call sites), `init_memory_system` update. No new structs,
no new files.

**Tests:** Extend TXT-01..04 (Phase 6) to cover bump-routed String allocations, frame rollback
of String-allocated data, and `String.use(NULL)` restoring the default path.

#### Addendum — External Controller Registration

Domain-specific controllers (e.g. `sc_string_ctrl_s` in sigma.text) live in their own codebase
but need sigma.memory to own their lifecycle at teardown. Three changes make this work cleanly:

**1. `SC_CTRL_FLAG_EXTERNAL` on `sc_ctrl_base_s`** (sigma.memory `include/internal/memory.h`)

```c
struct sc_ctrl_base_s {
    sc_alloc_policy  policy;
    slab             backing;
    usize            struct_size;
    bool             external;   // true → struct not in SLB0; slb0_free skipped on release
    object         (*alloc)  (struct sc_ctrl_base_s *, usize);
    void           (*free)   (struct sc_ctrl_base_s *, object);
    void           (*shutdown)(struct sc_ctrl_base_s *);
};
```

**2. `Allocator.register(sc_ctrl_base_s *)` — new slot on `sc_allocator_i`**

Allows any codebase to hand a controller into the registry without going through
`create_bump`/`create_reclaim`. The caller allocates the struct (typically at the head of its
own acquired slab), wires `base.shutdown` to its domain-specific teardown, sets
`base.external = true`, then calls `Allocator.register`. sigma.memory finds the next NULL
registry slot and stores the pointer — nothing more.

```c
// sigma.text — sc_string_ctrl_s lives here, sigma.memory never sees the concrete type
slab             s  = Allocator.acquire(2 * 1024 * 1024);
string_allocator sa = String.create_controller(s);   // alloc at head of s, wire shutdown
Allocator.register((sc_ctrl_base_s *)sa);            // hand lifecycle to sigma.memory
String.use(sa);
```

**3. `allocator_release` + `cleanup_memory_system` respect the flag**

- `allocator_release`: calls `ctrl->shutdown(ctrl)` + munmaps `ctrl->backing`; calls
  `slb0_free(ctrl)` **only if** `!ctrl->external`. External structs are owned by their
  domain — sigma.memory must not free them.
- `cleanup_memory_system`: walks registry slots 1–31, calls `shutdown` on each non-NULL
  entry (already in Phase 4 plan), then munmaps SLB0 and SYS0 as today.

This is the minimal surface. sigma.text defines the type and teardown logic. sigma.memory
registers and drives the lifecycle. Neither knows the other's internals.

### ~~FT-14~~ — `SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED_APP`: Trusted Application Registration ✅ Implemented (v0.3.x)

**Resolution:** FTA-01..04 pass. `SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED_APP = 3` dispatches through
`sigma_module_set_trusted_app_grant`; app-tier caps draw from a separate 8-slot pool and
never touch R1–R6. `TRUSTED_APP_SLOT_MAX 8u` constant and `memory_trusted_app_cap()`/
`memory_trusted_app_reset()` test utilities in place. Sigma.core FR-2603-sigma-core-002 closed.

**Context:** FT-11 introduced Ring1 trusted subsystems (R1–R6) for first-party system-level
modules (sigma.tasking, anvil.lite, sigma.io, etc.). These slots are reserved for infrastructure.
First-party application-layer consumers (e.g. sigma.test) are trusted in the sense that we own
and audit them, but they should not consume system ring slots.

**What it adds:**

- `SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED_APP = 3` in `sc_module_role` (sigma.core `module.h`) — new tier, separate
  from `SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED` (Ring1).
- A second grant pool in sigma.memory: `s_trusted_app_caps[N]` with its own slot counter,
  independent of `s_trusted_caps[6]` (R1–R6 never touched).
- `sigma_module_set_trusted_app_grant(fn)` registration point in sigma.core dispatch —
  sigma.memory registers its implementation in `memory_module_init`, unmodified dispatch loop
  calls it when it encounters `SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED_APP` modules.
- The cap returned is the same generic `sc_trusted_cap_t` — no special type. Consumers hold
  `alloc_use` and call through it.

**ABI surface (generic — no consumer-specific wiring):**

```c
// sigma.core/module.h — enum addition
typedef enum {
    SIGMA_ROLE_SYSTEM      = 0,
    SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED     = 1,
    SIGMA_ROLE_USER        = 2,
    SIGMA_ROLE_TRUSTED_APP = 3,   // ← NEW: first-party app tier
} sc_module_role;

// sigma.core/module.h — new registration fn typedef + extern
typedef sc_trusted_cap_t *(*sc_trusted_app_grant_fn)(const char *name,
                                                      usize arena_size,
                                                      sc_alloc_policy arena_policy);
void sigma_module_set_trusted_app_grant(sc_trusted_app_grant_fn fn);
```

**sigma.memory additions:**
- `trusted_app_grant(name, size, policy)` — implementation, draws from app pool
- `s_trusted_app_caps[8]`, `s_next_app_slot` — separate state, no interaction with R1–R6
- `memory_trusted_app_reset()` — test-utility companion to `memory_trusted_reset()`
- `TRUSTED_APP_SLOT_MAX 8u` constant in `memory.h`

**Tests:** `test/unit/test_trusted_app.c` — FTA-01..04
- FTA-01: grant returns non-NULL cap with populated `alloc_use`
- FTA-02: app slot does not overlap R1–R6 (slot range > TRUSTED_SLOT_MAX)
- FTA-03: alloc/write/free through `alloc_use` — valgrind clean
- FTA-04: overflow beyond slot max → NULL

**Prerequisite:** sigma.core FR-2603-sigma-core-002 (enum + dispatch fn — must be resolved first).

**Effort:** Medium — mirrors FT-11 implementation. New pool, new registration fn, new test suite.

### ~~FT-15~~ — Frame operations on `sc_alloc_use_t` ✅ Implemented (v0.3.x)

**Resolution:** `frame_begin`/`frame_end` added to `sc_alloc_use_t` (sigma.core FR-2603-sigma-core-003
closed). `trusted_app_grant` wires both fields unconditionally — both POLICY_BUMP and
POLICY_RECLAIM controllers support frames, so the original "NULL for RECLAIM" plan was
revised: all app-tier caps expose full frame support. Per-slot shims
(`trusted_a1_frame_begin`..`trusted_a8_frame_begin` etc.) dispatch through
`trusted_app_slot_frame_begin/end` which branch on `ctrl->policy` at call time.

**Follow-up:** FTA-05..07 (frame tests on `alloc_use`) not yet written — tracked as TG-07.

**Context:** `sc_alloc_use_t` today exposes only `alloc`/`release`/`resize`. Both the bump and
reclaim controllers already support `frame_begin`/`frame_end` internally (vtable on
`sc_bump_ctrl_s` and `sc_reclaim_ctrl_s`). Any consumer holding an `alloc_use` — including
trusted-app modules — cannot bracket a frame without knowing the concrete controller type.

A "sandbox" for a test case is exactly a frame on a bump-backed arena: `frame_begin` saves the
cursor, the test allocs freely, `frame_end` resets everything atomically. There is no new
concept — only the public surface is missing.

**What it adds:**

```c
// sigma.core/allocator.h — extended sc_alloc_use_t
typedef struct sc_alloc_use_s {
    void  *(*alloc)  (usize size);
    void   (*release)(void *ptr);
    void  *(*resize) (void *ptr, usize size);
    frame  (*frame_begin)(void);         // ← NEW: save cursor / sequence tag
    void   (*frame_end)  (frame f);      // ← NEW: bulk reclaim to saved point
} sc_alloc_use_t;
```

`frame_begin` and `frame_end` are NULL for SLB0/reclaim-backed `alloc_use` instances that
don't support frames, or wired to the ctrl's vtable for bump-backed instances. Callers check
for NULL before invoking (or accept a `FRAME_NULL` sentinel return).

**sigma.memory changes:**
- `trusted_grant` and `trusted_app_grant` wire `frame_begin`/`frame_end` when policy is
  `POLICY_BUMP`; leave NULL for `POLICY_RECLAIM`.
- `sc_reclaim_ctrl_s` frame support already exists (seq-tag based); wire it too.
- Existing `sc_alloc_use_t` in SLB0 facade: `frame_begin`/`frame_end` wired to SLB0 reclaim ctrl.

**Consumer pattern (generic — sigma.test or any other trusted-app):**

```c
sc_alloc_use_t *use = &cap->alloc_use;
frame f = use->frame_begin();       // bracket start
object p = use->alloc(1024);        // alloc within frame
use->frame_end(f);                  // entire frame released atomically
// p is no longer valid
```

**Prerequisite:** FT-14 (trusted-app grant must exist before extending `alloc_use` wiring).

**Tests:** Extend `test_trusted_app.c` (FTA-05..07) or new `test_alloc_use_frames.c`
- FTA-05: `frame_begin` on bump-backed `alloc_use` returns non-FRAME_NULL
- FTA-06: `frame_end` reclaims all allocs in frame (ctrl cursor returns to pre-frame position)
- FTA-07: `frame_begin`/`frame_end` on reclaim-backed `alloc_use` — seq-tag bulk free

**Effort:** Small-Medium — vtable wiring in memory.c grant paths, two new fields on allocator.h
struct (sigma.core FR needed), NULL-guard in consumers. No new controller logic.

## Testing Gaps

### TG-01 — Code coverage tooling not set up 🟠 High

**Problem:** The ROADMAP targets 90%+ line coverage and 85%+ branch coverage, but there is no
`gcov`/`lcov` integration in the build system. Coverage is entirely aspirational with no
measurement.

**What it solves:** Turns a qualitative claim into a tracked metric. Exposes untested branches
(error paths, edge conditions) that may hide bugs like BG-01/BG-02.

**Fix:** Add a `cbuild coverage` target: compile with `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage`, run test
suite, generate `lcov` report to `docs/coverage/`. Integrate into CI.

> **Note:** Coverage tooling will also land via the **Sigma.X** toolchain. The `cbuild coverage`
> target above is a useful local addition in the meantime.

---

### TG-02 — Performance benchmarks not in regular CI 🟡 Medium

**Problem:** `test/performance/test_allocation_throughput.c` and `test_search_scaling.c` exist
but are not run as part of the standard `rtest unit` or `rtest integration` pass. Regressions in
allocation speed or B-tree search time go undetected.

**What it solves:** Catches performance regressions before release; gives baseline numbers for
tuning work (FT-05, FT-06).

**Fix:** Add a `rtest perf` category; run benchmarks in CI in opt mode; record baseline numbers
in `test/performance/benchmark_journal.md` and fail if throughput drops >10%.

> **Note:** Performance tracking tooling will also arrive via the **Sigma.X** toolchain.
> Maintain `benchmark_journal.md` manually in the meantime to preserve baseline data.

---

### TG-03 — Integration test suite partially blocked � High

**File:** `test/integration/test_integration.c`, `docs/PHASE7_TEST_AUDIT.md`  
**Problem:** Several integration tests were marked `⏸️ BLOCKED` during Phase 7 development and
have not been revisited since Phase 7 completed. The test suite may contain stale assertions or
incomplete coverage of the full alloc → grow → dispose lifecycle across scopes.

**What it solves:** Ensures the system-level integration path (SLB0 + NodePool + arenas + frames
interacting together) has the same test confidence as the unit layer.

**Fix:** Audit `test/integration/test_integration.c` against current API; update or add test
cases for the full lifecycle.

**Effort:** Low — Phase 7 is complete; this is an audit + assertion-update task, not a new implementation.

---

### TG-04 — Stress tests not in standard run � High

**Files:** `test/stress/test_edge_cases.c`, `test_memory_exhaustion.c`, `test_sustained_load.c`  
**Problem:** Stress and exhaustion tests live in `test/stress/` but `rtest unit` doesn't run
them. `test_memory_exhaustion.c` and `test_sustained_load.c` are not in the standard build
output (`build/test/`), suggesting they may not compile cleanly against the current API.

**What it solves:** Exercises the allocator under adversarial conditions (exhaustion, sustained
pressure, edge input sizes) — exactly the paths where latent bugs hide.

**Fix:** Build and run all stress tests; fix any compilation failures; add `rtest stress` category.

**Effort:** Low — run existing files, fix any compile errors against current API, wire into `rtest stress`.

---

### TG-05 — No fuzz testing � Medium

**Problem:** Allocation size inputs are only exercised by hand-written test cases. A fuzzer
(libFuzzer or AFL) targeting `Allocator.alloc(random_size)` + `Allocator.dispose` + `realloc`
sequences would find size-boundary bugs and integer overflow paths that deterministic tests miss.

**What it solves:** Catches correctness issues at unusual sizes (0, 1, `SIZE_MAX`, powers-of-2
boundaries, `kAlign` ± 1).

**Approach:** Incremental — add one fuzz target each time a source file is opened for modification.
Start with `Allocator.alloc` size boundaries; expand to `realloc` sequences and `dispose`
corner cases over time.

---

### TG-06 — No test coverage for `Frame.begin_in` / `Frame.end_in` on arenas 🟠 High

**Context:** FT-04 was marked resolved — `Frame.begin_in(scope)` / `Frame.end_in(scope, frame)`
exist in the v0.2.3 API. However, no test suite exercises frames on a user arena scope.

**What it solves:** Confirms the v0.2.3 sub-interface wiring is correct and catches any
regression where `begin_in` on an arena silently operates on the wrong scope.

**Fix:** Create `test/unit/test_arena_frames.c` with cases: frame on arena allocates from arena,
`end_in` bulk-disposes correctly, arena remains valid and allocatable after frame disposal,
`begin_in` on two different arenas independently track frame state.

---

### TG-07 — `alloc_use` frame tests (FTA-05..07) not yet written 🟠 High

**Context:** FT-15 wired `frame_begin`/`frame_end` into `sc_alloc_use_t` and all app-tier caps.
The implementation is complete and tested indirectly via the controller-level tests, but no test
exercises the frame API through the `alloc_use` surface directly.

**Fix:** Extend `test/unit/test_trusted_app.c` with:
- FTA-05: `frame_begin` on bump-backed `alloc_use` returns non-`FRAME_NULL`
- FTA-06: `frame_end` reclaims all allocs in frame (cursor returns to pre-frame position)
- FTA-07: `frame_begin`/`frame_end` on reclaim-backed `alloc_use` — seq-tag bulk free

**Effort:** Low — all infrastructure exists; tests are pure assertion wiring.

---

## Architecture / Design Debt

### AD-01 — SYS0 size is fixed at 8KB (no growth path) 🟠 High

**File:** `include/internal/memory.h` — `#define SYS0_PAGE_SIZE 8192`  
**Problem:** The SYS0 system page holds registers, scope table, bootstrap structures, and the
SLB0 first block. Its size is a compile-time constant and cannot grow. As new subsystems are
added (more scopes, more registers, larger scope metadata), SYS0 reserved space shrinks until
it is exhausted.

**What it solves:** Prevents an eventual hard ceiling on system-level growth without requiring a
full memory system redesign.

**Options:** Reserve an explicit growth header in SYS0; consider a two-tier model (fixed SYS0
header + dynamically-allocated extension page for overflow scope table entries).

> **Note:** Dynamic SYS0 growth carries real stability risk — internal paths assume registers and
> page-zero sentinel structures are at fixed addresses. The right upper bound isn't yet known.
> Deferred until real headroom pressure is observed in production use.

---

### AD-02 — Maximum 14 user arenas is a hard-coded structural limit 🟡 Medium

**File:** `include/internal/memory.h` — `scope_table` slots 2-15  
**Problem:** The scope table has 16 fixed slots. SYS0 occupies slot 0, SLB0 slot 1, leaving 14
user arena slots. Creating a 15th arena silently fails. The limit is a direct consequence of
the fixed SYS0 size (AD-01).

**What it solves:** Applications that need more than 14 isolated subsystem arenas are blocked.

**Fix:** Spillover scope table in a dynamically-allocated extension page, or increase SYS0 size
(ties to AD-01).

---

### ~~AD-03~~ — Frame nesting depth limit ✅ Resolved (v0.2.3)

**Resolution:** Nested frames were replaced with a **single active frame per scope**
(`MAX_FRAME_DEPTH = 1` in `include/internal/memory.h`). The R7 stack-of-frames approach was
removed; the `prev`-chain handles scope switching instead. No nesting depth limit applies to
the current design.

---

### AD-04 — `R1`–`R6` reserved but unassigned 🟢 Low → resolved by FT-11

**File:** `include/internal/memory.h` — `sc_registers_s`
**Status:** By design — intentionally held for Ring1 subsystem registration (FT-11).

**Register map (locked):**
```
R0 = s_sys0_base (sigma.memory self-pointer — set in bootstrap_sys0)
R1 = first  Ring1 trusted slot (sigma.tasking)
R2 = second Ring1 trusted slot (anvil.lite)
R3–R6 = future Ring1 slots (sigma.io, sigma.irq, sigma.msg, TBD)
R7 = SLB0 ctrl (immutable — set in bootstrap_slb0, never changes)
```

Slots R1–R6 are assigned sequentially as trusted modules register. A trusted module's
ctrl pointer is stored in its assigned R-slot for O(1) cross-module lookup.

---

### AD-05 — No public error reporting mechanism � High

**Problem:** Allocation failures return `NULL`. There is no structured error code, no last-error
query, and no diagnostic string. Callers cannot distinguish "out of memory", "size too large",
"arena exhausted", or "bad pointer". `fprintf(stderr, ...)` is used internally for fatal errors.

**What it solves:** Improves debuggability in production code where stderr is not visible; enables
callers to implement specific recovery strategies per error type.

**Proposed API:**
```c
typedef enum sc_error {
    SC_OK = 0,
    SC_ERR_OOM,              // Out of memory
    SC_ERR_TOO_LARGE,        // Requested size exceeds page capacity
    SC_ERR_SCOPE_FULL,       // POLICY_FIXED arena exhausted
    SC_ERR_SCOPE_LIMIT,      // Max scopes reached
    SC_ERR_FRAME_DEPTH,      // Max frame nesting reached
    SC_ERR_BAD_PTR,          // dispose/realloc on invalid pointer
} sc_error;

sc_error Memory.last_error(void);
const char *Memory.error_string(sc_error err);
```

**Effort:** Low — add a thread-local `sc_last_error` variable; set it at every `NULL`-returning
path; expose `Memory.last_error()` and `Memory.error_string()`.

---

## Documentation Gaps

### DG-01 — `PHASE7_TEST_AUDIT.md` is a stale planning artifact 🟢 Low

**File:** `docs/PHASE7_TEST_AUDIT.md`  
**Problem:** This document describes Phase 7 test impacts as of February 2026, when several
suites were `⏸️ BLOCKED`. Phase 7 is now complete. The doc shows stale `BLOCKED` status and
does not reflect the current passing state.

**Fix:** Archive (rename to `PHASE7_TEST_AUDIT_ARCHIVED.md`) or update all statuses to reflect
the current passing state.

---

### DG-02 — `v0.2.2_PLAN.md` is an outdated planning document 🟢 Low

**File:** `docs/v0.2.2_PLAN.md` (1039 lines)  
**Problem:** This is a pre-implementation planning document for v0.2.2. Now that v0.2.2 and
v0.2.3 are complete, it no longer reflects reality and adds noise when scanning the docs
directory.

**Fix:** Move to `docs/archive/` or reference it from MEMORY_DESIGN.md as historical context.

---

### DG-03 — No `CHANGELOG.md` (machine-readable release history) 🟡 Medium

**Problem:** Release history lives across `RELEASE_v0.2.x.md` files and `ROADMAP.md`. There is
no single machine-readable changelog in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format.
Tools that parse changelogs (npm, GitHub release notes, grepping for a version) cannot process
the current format.

**Fix:** Create `CHANGELOG.md` with `Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed` sections per version,
derived from the existing release notes.

---

## Candidate Items (Deferred Pending Need)

These are potentially useful features that have been explicitly deferred in the ROADMAP until
there is demonstrated demand.

| ID | Feature | Rationale for Deferral |
|----|---------|----------------------|
| CD-01 | `SCOPE_POLICY_BUMP` slab | Pure bump without B-tree — useful for deterministic-latency contexts, but arenas already provide this. Not adding until proven distinct need. |
| CD-02 | Allocation hints / size classes | Pre-segregated pools per size class (jemalloc-style). Beneficial at high allocation rates but adds structural complexity. Profile first. |
| CD-03 | `Memory.snapshot()`/`Memory.restore()` | Full system checkpoint. Powerful for test isolation but invasive to implement. Frames + arenas cover most cases today. |
| CD-04 | `mprotect` guard pages | Allocate guard pages around buffers (`PROT_NONE`) to catch overflows at the OS level. Useful in debug builds; significant overhead. |
| CD-05 | Allocator metrics / telemetry | Prometheus-style counters for `alloc_count`, `dispose_count`, `oom_count`. Useful for production observability but premature for current scale. |

---

## ✅ Resolved Items

| ID | Item | Resolved In |
|----|------|-------------|
| FT-04 | Arena frame support (`Frame.begin_in` / `Frame.end_in`) | v0.2.3 |
| AD-03 | Frame nesting depth limit (replaced with single-frame-per-scope model) | v0.2.3 |
| FT-01 | Thread-safety hooks — superseded by Trusted Subsystem Registration (see FT-11) | v0.3.0 |
